Name: generate_graph.py

Purpose: This scripts generates a graph with V vertices of D degrees
         and stores it in a Matrix Market format.

Requirements: This Python script requires Python 3 and the following
              packages: random, sys, numpy, scipy, networkx.

Usage: One need only provide the desired # of vertices and the desired
       degree as command line arguments (in that order). A quick review
       of the script will fill in the remaining details.
