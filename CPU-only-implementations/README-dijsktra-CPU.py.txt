Name: dijkstra-CPU.py

Purpose: This script runs one of NetworkX's implementations of Dijkstra's
         SSSP algorithm (the 'single_source_dijkstra_path' implementation,
         to be precise) on the specified graph.

Requirements: This Python script requires Python 3 and the following
              packages: sys, time, numpy, scipy, networkx.

Usage: On the command line, after the script name, specify the graph,
       which should be in Matrix Market format, and that is all for input.
       For output, the script will print the number of vertices and edges,
       and then the runtime in seconds and milliseconds.
