In this directory, one can find the zipped up copies of the original files,
the source code used for the SSSP implementation tested by the project, and
the source code used for the APSP implementation, which is really just the
SSSP implementation applied to each vertex. Also included are files that will
help in the creation of graph files as well as a PDF copy of the corresponding
paper by Harish and Narayanan.
